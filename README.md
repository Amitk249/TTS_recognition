# Text-to-Speech Application

## Overview

This Python-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application allows users to convert written text into natural-sounding speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) toolkit. The application features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, offering customizable controls to enhance the user experience. Extensive functional and usability testing was conducted to ensure the application meets user expectations and operates consistently.

## Features

- **Natural-Sounding Voice**: Utilizes the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) toolkit to generate high-quality, human-like speech from text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface created with Tkinter, allowing users to easily input text and customize settings.
- **Customizable Controls**: Options to adjust speech speed, language, and save the generated speech as an audio file.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly tested for functionality and usability to ensure a reliable and pleasant user experience.
